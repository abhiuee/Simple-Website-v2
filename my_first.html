        World Wide Web
      </h3>
        The <b>World Wide Web</b> (<em>www</em>) is an open source 
        information space where documents and other web resources are 
        identified by <b>URLs</b> (<em>links</em>), interlinked by 
        hypertext links, and can be accessed via the <b>Internet</b>. 
        Basic elements of web are as follows:  
        <ul>
          <li>Computer</li>
          <li>Internet</li>
          <li>Server</li>
          <li>HTTP Protocol</li>
        </ul>
        When a person goes to a web page like www.google.com, their 
        computer sends a <b>HTTP</b> request to a <b>server</b>. The 
        server finds the appropriate <b>HTML</b> document and sends it  
        back to the user's computer where a web browser interprets the 
        page and displays it on the user's screen.

        HTML
      </h3>
        HyperText Markup Language, commonly referred to as HTML, is the  
        standard markup language used to create web pages. <a href="
        http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">Click Here</a> to
        learn about HTML. A typical HTML document consists of:
        <ul>
          <li>Text Content</li>
          <li>Markup</li>
          <li>References to other documents</li>
          <li>Links to other pages</li>
        </ul>
      <div>
        <h4 id = "markup"> 
          Markup
        </h4>
          HTML markup consists of several key components, including
           those called tags (and their attributes), character-based 
           data types, character references and entity references. HTML 
            tags most commonly come in pairs like <b>&lt;b&gt;</b>
          and <b>&lt;/h1&gt;</b>, although some represent empty elements 
          and so are unpaired, for example <b>&lt;img&gt;</b>.  
        <h5>
          Elements
        </h5>
        <p>
          HTML documents imply a structure of nested elements. A typical 
          element consists of opening tag, text content and closing tag, 
          for example: 
          <div class="example">
            &lt;em&gt; hello &lt;/em&gt;
          </div>   
          HTML elements 
          are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible  
          box" around the content inside of them.
        <h5>
          Tag Attributes
        </h5>
          Some tags like <b>&lt;img&gt;</b> require modifiers to  
           describe their functionality. These modifiers are called tag 
           attributes or just attributes. An attribute either modifies 
           the default functionality of an element type or provides 
           functionality to certain element types unable to function 
           correctly without them. Example:
          <div class = "example">
            &lt;img src="source of 
            image" alt="text"&gt;

        <b>Cascading Style Sheet</b> (CSS) is a style sheet language 
        used for describing the presentation of a document written in a

      <p>
        The <b>Document Object Model</b> (DOM) is a cross-platform and 
        language-independent convention for representing and interacting 
        with objects in HTML, XHTML, and XML documents. The nodes of 
        every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM 
         tree. Objects in the DOM tree may be addressed and manipulated 
         by using methods on the objects.<br>
         The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. You can draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on...
        In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, and so on...

        How Web Works
      </h3>
      When we enter a URL <span id = "courier_new"> http://wwww.example.com/abc/a.html </span> in the browser, first, the browser slices the URL in 3 parts:
      <ol>
        <li> <span id = "courier_new"> http://</span>: This part indicates that the document you want to access can be retrieved from web server, which understands the HTTP protocol. 
        </li>
        <li> <span id = "courier_new">www.example.com</span>: This is the host name of the computer from which the document can be downloaded. 
        </li>
        <li> <span id = "courier_new">/abc/a.html</span>: This is the virtual path of the document in the www.example.com's web server.
        </li>
      </ol>
      Then, the browser contacts a DNS (Domain Name Server) to know the IP address of the computer whose full qualified domain name is www.example.com. The browser establishes a connection channel with the web server on the computer which IP address was given by the DNS server and requests the document using a GET request on the host which name is www.example.com and which virtual path is /abc/a.html. 

      The server decodes the request and maps the virtual path to a real one, which should match an existing file. The server sends the file to the browser with some useful information such as its last modification time and its MIME type. The MIME type helps the browser decide how to display the received document. In our example, it is a HTML file. So the server sets its MIME type to text/html and the browser understands that it must render it as text.
      <h4 id = "get_post">
        GET and POST
      </h4>
      POST is one of many request methods supported by the HTTP protocol used by the web. By design, the POST request method requests that a web server accepts and stores the data enclosed in the body of the request message. It is often used when uploading a file or submitting a completed web form. <br><br>

      The HTTP GET request method is designed to retrieve information from the server. As part of a GET request, some data can be passed within the URL's query string, specifying for example search terms, date ranges, or other information that defines the query. <br>

      A client like a browser sends a HTTP request (for example: GET and POST) and the server responds with a response message. Examples of GET and POST request and response are shown in the figures below:
      <div class = "flex">
        <div class = "get_post_image">

    A web application is a software application that runs on a remote server. In most cases, web browsers are used to access web applications, over a network. Web applications require very little compute power on the client as most of the processing happens on the server and client only displays data. Also, these applications solve some of the compatibility issues.

      HTML Validation
    </h3>
    HTML Validation is an important concept that allows unscrupulous usage of HTML documents. Escaping is one such feature where any input from users is first validated by removing all the escape characters so that the text is actually interpreted as text rather than some code or HTML tag. <br><br>
    The goal of web form validation is to ensure that the user provided necessary and properly formatted information needed to successfully complete an operation. In server-side validation, information is being sent to the server and validated using one of server-side languages. The user needs to submit the information so that it can be validated on the server side. For better user-experience, client-side validation is required. This validation is done on client side using script languages such as Javascript. The user's data can be validated as they type. <br><br>
    Validating input is important to have user specify information required to access a web page (for example password and user_name should be required fields), formatted information (for example user_name should contain only alphabets and digits), escaping (remove escape characters from input) etc. Validation is a very important way to ensure security. Input filters which help in rejecting shell injection or other types of scrupulous scripting. Rejecting access to blacklisted users or allowing access to only authorized and registered users.

      HTML Templates
    </h3>
    HTML templates is a feature which allows reuse of HTML by using concepts like variable substitution and inheritance. One such environment that allows HTML templates is Jinja environment which can be used in Google App Engine. Using templates, removes all the bulky HTML from the backend code and all the HTML documents are then generated dynamically. <br><br>
    Programmers use HTML templates to ensure reusability of the HTML that needs to be remain same for different web pages. The template based programming allows simplicity. In a server-side system like Jinja, programmers are able to avoid repetition and reduce time spent coding and debugging by dynamically generating the HTML pages based on the state of the system and the user inputs. These templates systems also provide debug systems that can integrate compile and runtime errors into the server-side language console. Since reuse is performed by using techniques like inheritance and variable substitution, the chances of incurring typos are reduced and common pieces for every page are properly displayed.

      Lesson 5: Additional Topics 
    </h2>
    In this section, I will explain the topics Javascript and APIs that I have explored further during this course. To illustrate the concepts, I added a feature that allows user to optionally provide their location. To do so, I created a save location check box which when checked calls a javascript function that logs in the user's location in latitudes and longitudes by using the geolocation feature. Once the coordinates are logged in and the user presses submit comments button, the python script uses google maps api and gets a JSON that has the location corresponding to the coordinates specified. The JSON is parsed and city and country is identified for the user.

        Javascript
      </h3>
      JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the three essential technologies of World Wide Web content production; the majority of websites employ it and it is supported by all modern web browsers without plug-ins. JavaScript runs on the client side of the web, which can be used to design / program how the web pages behave on the occurrence of an event. To use javascript functionality in HTML, you can either source it from a separate file or you can write it inline. To source it from a separate file, the syntax in HTML is <span id = "courier_new">&lt;script src = "js location"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>. For inline use, the syntax is similar <span id = "courier_new">&lt;script&gt;js constructs&lt;/script&gt;</span>. <br><br>
      JavaScript statements are composed of: values, operators, expressions, keywords, and comments. JS can be used to display output in different ways like, append or prepend to an element in HTML, create a pop up box. JS functions can be provided as actions to different HTML elements. For example, in <span id = "courier_new">&lt;input type = "checkbox" onclick = clicked(this)&gt;</span>, clicked(this) javascript function will be called when the user toggles the checkbox. Following are some of the resources I used to learn about JS:
      <ul>

          <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">Wikipedia</a>: This article explains the basics of JS, its history, uses etc.

        APIs
      </h3>
      In computer programming, an application programming interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. An API expresses a software component in terms of its operations, inputs, outputs, and underlying types, defining functionalities that are independent of their respective implementations, which allows definitions and implementations to vary without compromising the interface. A good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks, which are then put together by the programmer. <br><br>
      One of the most frequently used API on web is Google Maps API. This API provides a way to communicate with Google Maps Servers and ask for location based information. The API communicates with the client by writing a JSON or an XML file which can be parsed to understand the results. APIs on web allow different services to communicate with each other and obliterate the need for writing same service which might have already been written and maintained by somebody else. Big corporations like Google and Twitter, provide developers different APIs to create better web applications. Another example of APIs would be the common login feature provided by Facebook. The Facebook login feature allows small website creaters to use Facebook credentials to authenticate the user, instead of themselves creating a login feature. Also, it helps users as commonly used logins like Facebook and Google can now be used to access other websites. Some resources that are interesting to learn about APIs are as follows:
